Welcome to my GitHub profile!

## 🌟 About Me
I recently discovered my passion for computer and web development 💻, and I am eager to learn and explore more every day 🌟. Although I am relatively new in this field, I spent about 10 years as a breakdancer 🕺 who taught me about the value of collaboration and creating something meaningful with others 🤝. I enjoy working together to create and share amazing things ✨. Let's create something wonderful together! 🚀

Maybe not today 🌅, maybe not tomorrow 🌄, and maybe not next month 📅, but I will make it 🔥💪.
